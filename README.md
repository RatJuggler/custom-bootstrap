A small project to customise BootStrap with a different base font and some different colours.

Use `npm run scss` to generate a custom bootstrap CSS file (css/custom.css) from the SCSS definition (scss/custom.scss).

Use `npm run watch` to generate a custom CSS file as above then watch for further changes to the SCSS definition and regenerate as required.
